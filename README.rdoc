Wyncode Trio Project with team members Ravi Bakhai and Alec Greenberg.

This was a week seven project I developed with my team.  The idea was to create a fully functioning application in less than forty eight hours to present in front of family, friends and peers for "Friends and Family Night" at Wyncode.  Soundbass is a music playlist file sharing application where you can upload a user created playlist, discover trending playlists, recommend them to your friends and even rate them.
